Four children, Zanokuhle, two weeks old, Onge, 2 years old, Noluthando, 9 years old, Anathi, 9 years old and their mother Bongekile Mthembu, 37, met gruesome deaths when the house they were sleeping in caught fire on Saturday evening.

They were later transferred to hospital where Onge succumbed to his injuries on Sunday afternoon. On Monday, two other family members who died in hospital were identified as Thobeka, 31, and Ayabonga, 7. In a joint statement, the provincial government and Department of Social Development said on Tuesday, Premier Sihle Zikalala and Department of Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza would visit the family who lost seven family members as a result of the fire. Zikalala and Khoza will visit the KwaNhlalwane area in the Umzumbe Local Municipality to pay their respects to the family. The Department of Social Development, Umzumbe Local Municipality and various stakeholders have been on the ground trying to help the traumatised family and neighbours.

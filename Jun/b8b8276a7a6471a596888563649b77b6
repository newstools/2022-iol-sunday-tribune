Cape Town - Police have confirmed they are investigating another case of robbery and kidnapping after an e-hailing driver said he escaped with his life during a horror hijacking. Speaking to the Cape Times this week, Dieudonné Mwamba-Nzambi Ngoyi, 47, said he was an attack victim after he was hijacked outside his Wynberg home and forced to drive to Philippi at gunpoint. Ngoyi said he has been a Bolt driver since 2019 and now wanted to live in hiding after receiving death threats. Police spokesperson Frederick van Wyk confirmed a case of robbery with a firearm and kidnapping were being investigated. “According to reports, the complainant was sitting in his vehicle when a person got into his passenger seat with a firearm. He was then instructed to drive to Marikana informal settlement where more suspects were waiting. His belongings were taken, as well as car keys. After talking to him they returned his car keys and he then drove back to Wynberg to open a case. No suspects have been arrested at this stage,” said Van Wyk. Ngoyi said he feared for his family’s lives. “They have threatened my family after my life was spared. To be honest with you, I am very scared and worried about my four kids,” he said Country manager for Bolt, Takura Malaba, said while they have not noticed an increase in hijackings and attempted hijackings, there were a number of flagged areas. “We do see reports of incidents at a constant level in some key hot spots, which we communicate to drivers. These areas include Belhar, Brackenfell, Brackenfell South, Hector Ave, Belville, Mitchells Plain, Parow, Goodwood, Athlone, Kraaifontein, Woodstock, Philippi, Delft, Gugulethu, Crossroads, Browns Farms, Nyanga, Phola Park and Grassy Park.

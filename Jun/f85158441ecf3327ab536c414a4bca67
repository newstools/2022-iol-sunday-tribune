Durban — The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has chosen eThekwini as the city to hold its much anticipated elective conference. This was confirmed by the party spokesperson Nhlakanipho Ntombela to the Daily News on Sunday.  Ntombela said after the provincial executive committee meeting, the party decided that the conference be held in Durban, adding that the party has the option of using the Durban University of Technology campus or the Olive Convention Centre near the beach. As the regions wrap up their nominations in two weeks, it looks like it will be a race between the current provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala, AmaZulu Football Club owner Sandile Zungu and Finance MEC Nomusa Dube Ncube who is also the ANC provincial treasurer. They have all emerged as favourites as branches rush to meet the end of the month deadline. Ntombela said it was difficult to know which leader has received more nominations than the others since nominations come sealed to the provincial office. “We can confirm eThekwini as the city where we will hold our conference but we will decide which venue we use between DUT and Olive Convention Centre. For now, we are talking to both the management of the places. As for nominations, we will know who is nominated once boxes have been opened after the nomination deadline,” said Ntombela. Meanwhile, the newly-elected ANC Youth League leadership in eThekwini called on party branches to elect more young people as delegates to the provincial conference.  Thulisa Ndlela, who was elected as the secretary, told the paper on Sunday that their conference did not pronounce on which leaders or slate they would support but decided to swell the delegates with young people first, saying it would be unreasonable to talk about one’s leadership choice whereas they do not have numbers to ensure they would be elected. The conference will be held from July 15 to 17. Daily News

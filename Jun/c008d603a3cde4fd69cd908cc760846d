Durban – Nearly one hundred ANC branches across KwaZulu-Natal have held their Branch General Meetings (BGM) where they have discussed and nominated their preferred candidates to lead the governing party in the province. The ANC provincial elective conference is set to take place next month. While the top five positions in the ANC in the province are up for grabs, it is the position of provincial chairperson where Sihle Zikalala and Nomusa Dube-Ncube’s names have emerged as the main contenders, setting the stage for what could be a bruising encounter.  On Sunday, different branches in eThekwini raised the names of the two to lead the party in the province. ANC provincial spokesperson Nhlakanipho Ntombela said branches across the province had started holding BGMs and the process was one of the items that were up for discussion at the meeting of the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) on Monday.  “We are going to get a report indicating how many branches have now undertaken this exercise so that we get a picture as to whether the process will be concluded ahead of the conference,” said Ntombela yesterday.  The PEC meeting continued through the evening on Monday and Ntombela could not be reached for further comment. THE MERCURY

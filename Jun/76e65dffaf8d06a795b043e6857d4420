Durban - The eThekwini Municipality’s Business Support and Tourism unit are hosting a Art Bar Exhibition at the weekend. The city said the exhibition at 211 Florida Road on this Saturday and Sunday, June 4 and 5,  served to recognise the role of arts and culture in the growth of the economy. Mxolisi Kaunda, eThekwini mayor said that crafts, fine art, and visual art continue to play a significant role in the socio-economic and cultural life of rural and developing communities. “Over the years, crafts have become highly commercialised, which has influenced new understanding and interpretations. This in turn has become a reference for many fashion trends and accessories,” he said. The municipality said that the festival aims to provide a platform for businesses in the sector to trade and engage with art enthusiasts, the public, and potential buyers to contribute to their growth. “Over 60 local producers in the creative space will be exhibiting. On display will be visual art, crafts, and fine art products,” he said. The city said that the two-day festival will also include a formal skills training programme for exhibitors and attendees. “The programme will include an address by prominent crafter Hlengiwe Zulu who will be speaking on ‘The Secrets of Beads’. There will be a pottery demonstration, interactive live drawing for kids, and an accessories showcase,” he said. Among the exhibitors would be Nela Kahle Art and Crafts and Gugu Mobile Boutique. “Nela Kahle Art and Crafts is a skills development company that also manufactures world class bead accessories and décor items, Gugu Mobile Boutique is famously known for producing quality and exclusive modernised African accessories,” he said. The event is being hosted in collaboration with the Durban Art Gallery. THE MERCURY

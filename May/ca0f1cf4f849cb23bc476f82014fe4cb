DURBAN - Controversial ANC member Carl Niehaus says he is humbled by the fact that a traditional music artist from northern KwaZulu-Natal has composed a song about him, saying such a revolutionary song encourages him to soldier on with the Struggle. The song by a Jozini artist, Ingcwenga, showers praise on Niehaus, labelling him a champion of radical economic transformation. Writing on his Twitter page on Thursday, the MK veteran and former ANC NEC member said he was touched by the song.  “I warmly thank comrade #Ingcwenga from Jozini, in KZN for this beautiful revolutionary song about me. I am touched and humbled by it,” Niehaus wrote. He also shared the song on his Twitter page.

I know that there are lots of fake accounts out there but that one is really mine. To have a song composed about one is quite an honour and that is why one is really humbled by the experience," Niehaus told The Mercury on Thursday. He explained that the Mpangazitha name had been given to him by the lobby group called Injeje yabanguni, adding that he had been equally honoured to have the name bestowed on him. Many took to social media to express support for Niehaus and the song, saying that it suited him.  Mlalazi kaNoxhaka said: “I have much respect & love for Cde Carl.” Sizwe Mkwanazi described the former MP as a fearless freedom fighter, adding that the song was a fitting tribute to his contribution.  “Oh Mpangazitha, son of Niehaus, he, who whips the advocates of white monopoly capital till they seek the nearest hideout,” said Mkwanazi. In his profile, Niehaus, a former member of Parliament and chairperson of the correctional services portfolio committee, describes himself as a patriotic South African and committed member of the ANC.

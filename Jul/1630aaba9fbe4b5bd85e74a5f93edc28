Durban — The DA has reported that they learnt that the eThekwini Water and Sanitation Department has sent a team to fix the overflowing sewage issue in Merebank and Lamontville. The DA said this followed pressure from the party. Last week the “Daily News” reported that Merebank and Lamontville residents were fuming at eThekwini Municipality for failing to repair burst sewerage pipes which they claimed had resulted in faeces spilling over their yards. Residents told the publication that they have been besieged by dirt all over their yards for months because the municipality had not responded to their pleas to fix the problem. DA deputy provincial chairperson Sithembiso Ngema said they had conducted oversight visits to the communities last week after the outcry. “The team dispatched by the city management were visible on the ground. We are hopeful that they are able to bring permanent relief for these communities,” Ngema said. “The city needs to prioritise the maintenance of infrastructure and set aside a budget that is going to fix our pump stations.” Ngema said the incident was not unique to the two communities. For years, communities across the municipality have been plagued by the constant sewage leaks, Ngema said. He said they had since written to Water and Sanitation head Ednick Msweli for answers to the following questions: “We have also called on this department to compile and share a status report about sewage leaks across the city,” Ngema said. “These sewage leaks are a health hazard and if they are left unattended, will have a detrimental impact on the lives of the residents of this city.” Daily News

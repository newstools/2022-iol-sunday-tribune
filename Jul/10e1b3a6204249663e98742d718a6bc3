Durban — A man and woman arrested for murder were remanded in custody for a formal bail application after their first court appearance on Friday. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said that last Tuesday, a case of kidnapping was registered at Inanda police station after Akhona Mkhize, 23, was kidnapped by unknown suspects at Matabetulu, in Inanda. She said Akhona had visited her boyfriend and was kidnapped by unknown suspects while her boyfriend was not present. “Information was received that the vehicle with suspects that kidnapped her was seen leaving the premises with the ex-girlfriend of Akhona’s boyfriend,” Gwala said. On Wednesday, Inanda SAPS detectives assisted by police officers from the Stabilisation Operation Team deployed in the province conducted an operation to trace the kidnapped victim and the suspects. “The operation yielded positive results when they arrested a 34-year-old woman who later admitted that she orchestrated the kidnapping with the assistance of another man.” “The investigation led the team to a dumping site at Buffelsdraai in Verulam where the body of Akhona was found with strangulation marks,” Gwala said. She said that the vehicle that was used in the commission of the crime was seized at Avoca Hills for further investigation. “A 24-year-old man was traced and located at Echibini in Ixopo where he was arrested.” “Both suspects appeared before the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on July 22, 2022. They were remanded in custody for a formal bail application.” Daily News
